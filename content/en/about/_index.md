Any company that develops and distributes software using open source must establish an effective open source program. This is in order to reduce legal risks while creating maximum value by actively managing all open source-related activities.

* SK telecom has established OSPO<sub>Open Source Program Office</sub> to establish open source governance policies, establish processes, and provide tools to automate them.
* Also SK telecom has organized OSRB (Open Source Review Board) to cooperate with the technology, legal, infrastructure, and education teams to establish open source strategy and implement detailed action plans.
